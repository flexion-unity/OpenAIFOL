# Welcome to OpenAIFOL
AIFOL is an acronym for '[All Is Full of Love](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_Is_Full_of_Love)', a song by Icelandic musician [Björk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bj%C3%B6rk). 
The song was initially released in 1997 on Björks third studio album 'Homogenic'.

In 1999 a variant of the song was released along with the famous [music video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u0cS1FaKPWY) directed by Chris Cunningham.
The music video depicts Björk as a robot who passionately kisses another robot while being assembled in an ethereal sterile white factory. The video was enhanced with post production CGI effects that count as a milestone in computer animation.

## OpenAIFOL
[OpenAIFOL](https://openaifol.flexion.io) is a 3D mesh copy created from scratch, featuring the robot and the assembly factory room. The initial Blender 3D mesh was created in 2017 by 'flexion' while creating a MS-HoloLens Unity3D educational project. Later the 3D mesh was also used for a WebGL real time browser demo and even turned into a 3D printing project in 2019 for the 20th anniversary of this epic music video.

## 3D Print
If you want to print your own 'All Is Full Of Love' diorama, you can find the STL sources for all required parts [here](3D-Print/).

## Contribute
This started as a simple non-commercial HoloLens fun project. Although countless hours have been invested in both the initial 3D scene for the HoloLens (with limited detail) and the redesign for 3D printable parts (with simplified parts optimized for printing), the detail level of the scene is still rather simple and contributions for improvements are welcome. The main 3D mesh was created in Blender 2.79.
