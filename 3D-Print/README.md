# OpenAIFOL 3D-Print
Welcome to the OpenAIFOL 3D-Printing project by 'flexion'.

## What is AIFOL?
AIFOL is an acronym for '[All Is Full of Love](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_Is_Full_of_Love)', a song by Icelandic musician [Björk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bj%C3%B6rk). 
The song was initially released in 1997 on Björks third studio album 'Homogenic'.

In 1999 another variant of the song was released along with the famous [music video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u0cS1FaKPWY) directed by Chris Cunningham.
The music video depicts Björk as a robot who passionately kisses another robot while being assembled in an ethereal sterile white factory. The video was enhanced with post production CGI effects which count as a milestone in computer animation.

## OpenAIFOL
OpenAIFOL is a 3D mesh copy created from scratch, featuring the robot and the assembly factory room. The initial Blender 3D mesh was created in 2017 by 'flexion' while creating a MS-HoloLens Unity3D educational augmented reality project. Later the 3D mesh was also used for a WebGL real time browser demo and even converted for a 3D printing project in 2019 for the 20th anniversary of this epic music video.

## OpenAIFOL 3D-Print
OpenAIFOL 3D-Print is optimized for printing. The dimensions are 21.5cm x 31.5cm x 13.5cm and consists of several hundred pieces if you want to print the room, worker arm and the robot.

## 3D printing instructions
Currently there are no step by step assembly instructions available yet. If you want to build your own AIFOL diorama, use the provided photos as a reference. Printable parts are categorized by object and filament color is part of the filename. Some parts have to be printed more than once.

Required filament colors:
 - White
 - Black
 - Silver or light gray
 
You will also need some plastic glue and a black pen.

Please note that in the video there is an inconsistency in the color of the center panels of the wall. At some points in the video all panels of the rear wall are either completely white, sometimes only the lower panel in the center is black with three of the small center panels also in black, and in another shot only one smaller panel in the center is black and the lower panel is white. Feel free to print those panels in whatever color combination you prefer.
